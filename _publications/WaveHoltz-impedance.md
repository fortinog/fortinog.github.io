collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-05-20-ImpWH
excerpt: 'This paper extends analysis of the WaveHoltz iteration, a time-domain iterative method for the 
solution of the Helmholtz equation, to problems with impedance boundary conditions 
in a single spatial dimension. We additionally analyze Helmholtz problems with damping, and 
we additionally show that it is possible to 
\textit{completely remove} time discretization error from the 
WaveHoltz solution through careful analysis of the discrete iteration
and updated quadrature formulas.'
