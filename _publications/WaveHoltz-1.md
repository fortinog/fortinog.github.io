excerpt: 'A new idea for iterative solution of the Helmholtz equation is presented. We show that the iteration which we denote WaveHoltz and which filters the solution to the wave equation with harmonic data evolved over one period, corresponds to a coercive operator or a positive definite matrix in the discretized case.'

A new idea for iterative solution of the Helmholtz equation is presented. We show that the iteration which we denote WaveHoltz and which filters the solution to the wave equation with harmonic data evolved over one period, corresponds to a coercive operator or a positive definite matrix in the discretized case.
