I am a 5th year graduate student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work with Dr. Daniel Appelö (now at MSU) and am a member of the [High Order Group](https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/danielappelo).

## Research Interests

## JuQBox: A Julia Quantum Control Toolbox
Work on a Julia package for quantum optimal control is now open-source! Find JuQBox [HERE](https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl)!

### Numerical Solution of PDE
I am interested in the numerical solution of PDE and PDE constrained optimization problems. In particular, I am interested in time-domain approaches to solutions of the Helmholtz equation and in the optimal control of control signals constrained by the Schrödinger equation for quantum computing systems.

### High Performance Computing 
I am interested in high performance implementations of numerical methods for solving PDEs. I am interested in designing algorithms which exploit the parallelism of modern many-core architectures.
