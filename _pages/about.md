I am an NSF postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences working 
with [Dr. Georg Stadler](https://math.nyu.edu/~stadler/).

I obtained a Ph.D. from the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) at CU Boulder. As a graduate student I worked with Dr. Daniel Appelö (now at MSU) and was a member of the [High Order Group](https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/danielappelo).

## Research Interests

### JuQBox: A Julia Quantum Control Toolbox
Work on a Julia package for quantum optimal control is now open-source! Find JuQBox [here](https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl)!

### Numerical Solution of PDE
I am interested in the numerical solution of PDE and PDE constrained optimization problems. In particular, I am interested in time-domain approaches to solutions of the Helmholtz equation and in the optimal control of control signals constrained by the Schrödinger equation for quantum computing systems.

### High Performance Computing 
I am interested in high performance implementations of numerical methods for solving PDEs. I am interested in designing algorithms which exploit the parallelism of modern many-core architectures.
