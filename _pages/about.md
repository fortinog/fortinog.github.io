I am an NSF postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

I obtained a Ph.D. from the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) at CU Boulder. As a graduate student I worked with Dr. Daniel Appelö (now at MSU) and was a member of the [High Order Group](https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/danielappelo).

<!-- ## Recent News
My research is primarily focused on numerical methods for wave propagation.

### Time-domain Approaches for Helmholtz problems

### JuQBox: A Julia Quantum Control Toolbox
Work on a Julia package for quantum optimal control is now open-source! Find JuQBox [here](https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl)!

### Numerical Solution of PDE
I am interested in the numerical solution of PDE and PDE constrained optimization problems. In particular, I am interested in time-domain approaches to solutions of the Helmholtz equation and in the optimal control of control signals constrained by the Schrödinger equation for quantum computing systems.
