I am a 4th year graduate student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work with Dr. Daniel Appelö and am a member of the High Order Group (https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/appelo/).

## Research Interests

### Numerical Solution of PDE
I am interested in the numerical solution of PDE and PDE constrained optimization problems. In particular, I am interested in time-domain approaches to solutions of the Helmholtz equation and in the optimal control of control signals constrained by the Schrödinger equation for quantum computing systems.

### High Performance Computing 
I am interested in high performance implementations of numerical methods for solving PDEs. I am interested in designing algorithms which exploit the parallelism of modern many-core architectures.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
