I am an NSF postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

I obtained a Ph.D. from the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) at CU Boulder. As a graduate student I worked with Dr. Daniel Appel√∂ (now at MSU) and was a member of the [High Order Group](https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/danielappelo).


## Teaching 
In Fall 2022 I'm teaching Mathematics for Economics III (MATH-UA 133). Office hours for the course are Tuesday from 2:30PM-3:30PM and Thursday from 1:30PM-2:30PM in WWH 906.

## Software
Work on a Julia package for quantum optimal control is now open-source! Find JuQBox [here](https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl)!
