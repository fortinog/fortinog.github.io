*I have left NYU and joined the R&D division of [Cadence Design Systems](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home.html) as a Principal Software Engineer on the [Allegro X AI team](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/pcb-design-and-analysis/allegro-x-design-platform.html#allegro-x-ai).*

I was previously an NSF postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I obtained a Ph.D. from the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) at CU Boulder. As a graduate student I worked with Dr. Daniel Appel√∂ (now at Virginia Tech) and was a member of the [High Order Group](https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/appel-high-order-group).


## Software
Work on a Julia package for quantum optimal control is now open-source! Find JuQBox [here](https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl)!
